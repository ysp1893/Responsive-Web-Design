## Basic HTML and HTML5

### Introduction to Basic HTML:

   HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language used to describe the structure of a web page. It uses a special syntax or notation to organize and give information        about the page to the browser. Elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content.
   - Example:

    ```
    <h1>Top level heading: Maybe a page title</h1>

    <p>A paragraph of text. Some information we would like to communicate to the viewer. This can be as long or short as we would like.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Number one on the list</li>
      <li>Number two</li>
      <li>A third item</li>
    </ol>
    ```
 
 1. Headings
    This element tells the browser about the structure of your website. h1 elements are often used for main headings, while h2 elements are generally used for subheadings. There       are also h3, h4, h5 and h6 elements to indicate different levels of subheadings.
   **Example:**
   ```
   <h1>First Heading</h1>
   <h2>Second Heading</h2>
   <h3>Third Headind</h3>
   <h4>Fourth Heading</h4>
   <h5>Fifth Heading</h5>
   <h6> Sixth Heading</h6>
   ```
   
 2. Paragraph Element
    p elements are the preferred element for paragraph text on websites. p is short for "paragraph". You can create a paragraph element like this:
    ```
      <p> This is Paragraph </p>
    ```
   
 3. Comment in HTML  
    Commenting is a way that you can leave comments for other developers within your code without affecting the resulting output that is displayed to the end user.
    Commenting is also a convenient way to make code inactive without having to delete it entirely. Comments in HTML start with ``` <!-- and end with a --> ```
